# Milvus Operator

> **ATTENTIONS:** THE `MAIN` BRANCH MAY BE IN AN UNSTABLE OR EVEN BROKEN STATE DURING DEVELOPMENT.

## Overview
[Milvus](https://milvus.io) is a cloud-native, open-source vector database built to manage embedding vectors generated by machine learning models and neural networks. It extends the capabilities of best-in-class approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search libraries (e.g. Faiss, NMSLIB, Annoy) and features on-demand scalability, and high availability.

The Milvus Operator provides an easy and solid solution to deploy and manage a full Milvus service stack including both the milvus components and its relevant dependencies such as etcd, pulsar and minio to the target [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters in a scalable and high-available way. The Milvus Operator defines a milvuscluster custom resources on top of Kubernetes [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). The Kubernetes API can then be used in a declarative way to manage Milvus deployment stack and ensure its scalability and high-availability operation.
