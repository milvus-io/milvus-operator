# Upgrade Milvus Cluster with Milvus Operator

This topic describes how to ugrade your Milvus with Milvus Operator.

## Upgrade and downgrade through rolling update

For Milvus version >= v2.2.3, it supports rolling update for all components with mininum downtime.

You can enable it through the `spec.components.enableRollingUpdate`.

Then you can upgrade the image of Milvus through the `spec.components.image`.

Milvus-operator will follow the dependency order to update the components so that there will be as less downtime as possible.

```yaml
apiVersion: milvus.io/v1beta1
kind: Milvus
metadata:
  name: my-release
spec:
  components:
    enableRollingUpdate: true
    image: milvusdb/milvus:<some-new-version>
```

When you need to `downgrade` the image, you can specifiy the field `spec.components.imageUpdateMode` to `rollingDowngrade`. It will downgrade the image in the reverse order of the upgrade.

```yaml
apiVersion: milvus.io/v1beta1
kind: Milvus
metadata:
  name: my-release
spec:
  components:
    enableRollingUpdate: true
    # imageUpdateMode defaults to rollingUpgrade
    # rollingUpgrade / rollingDowngrade / all
    imageUpdateMode: rollingDowngrade 
    image: milvusdb/milvus:<some-old-version>
```

The ordered rolling upgrade may take a long time. In some emergency cases, you may just want to update the images together. You can set the field `spec.components.imageUpdateMode` to `all` to update all the components' image rightaway.

```yaml
apiVersion: milvus.io/v1beta1
kind: Milvus
metadata:
  name: my-release
spec:
  components:
    enableRollingUpdate: true
    # imageUpdateMode defaults to rollingUpgrade
    # rollingUpgrade / rollingDowngrade / all
    imageUpdateMode: all 
    image: milvusdb/milvus:<some-version>
```

`enableRollingUpdate` not only works when you update images. But also when you update the fields in `spec.config`.

## Upgrade By Change Milvus Image

For Milvus version earlier than v2.2.3, it only supports rolling update for proxy and nodes. 

Usually you can simply update your Milvus' image to upgrade to a new version. But the `coordinator` pods will first go down and then the new ones will be created. This will be a certain downtime.

#### Example

For example, if you're using Milvus v2.1.0 you can upgrade to Milvus v2.1.4 in this way.

```yaml
apiVersion: milvus.io/v1beta1
kind: Milvus
metadata:
name: my-release
labels:
app: milvus
spec:
  # Omit other fields ...
  components:
   image: milvusdb/milvus:v2.1.4
```

> If you want to upgrade Milvus from v2.1.4 or earlier to v2.2.0+, changing the image will lost your built index. you'll have to rebuild the index after upgrading. Or you can migrate your metadata before upgrade. Check the next section for more details.

## Upgrading Milvus 2.1.x to Milvus 2.2.x
The metadata structure of Milvus 2.2.x is different from that of Milvus 2.1.x. Therefore, you need to migrate the metadata of Milvus 2.1.x to Milvus 2.2.x. The following steps describe how to upgrade Milvus 2.1.4 to Milvus 2.2.0.

#### 1. Upgrade you Milvus Operator to v0.7.4 or later

Run the following command to upgrade the version of your Milvus Operator to v0.7.4

```
helm repo add milvus-operator https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-operator/
helm repo update milvus-operator
helm -n milvus-operator upgrade milvus-operator milvus-operator/milvus-operator
```


#### 2. Create a `milvusupgrade.yaml` file for metadata migration

Create a metadata migration file. The following is an example. You need to specify the `name`, `sourceVersion`, and `targetVersion` in the configuration file. The following example sets the `name` to `my-release-upgrade`, `sourceVersion` to `v2.1.4`, and `targetVersion` to `v2.2.0`. This means that your Milvus cluster will be upgraded from v2.1.4 to v2.2.0.

```yaml
apiVersion: milvus.io/v1beta1
kind: MilvusUpgrade
metadata:
  name: my-release-upgrade
spec:
  milvus:
    namespace: default
    name: my-release
  sourceVersion: "v2.1.4"
  targetVersion: "v2.2.0"
  # below are some omit default values:
  # targetImage: "milvusdb/milvus:v2.2.0"
  # toolImage: "milvusdb/meta-migration:v2.2.0"
  # operation: upgrade
  # rollbackIfFailed: true
  # backupPVC: ""
  # maxRetry: 3
```



#### 3. Apply the new configuration

Run the following command to start upgrading your Milvus cluster.

```
$ kubectl apply -f milvusupgrade.yaml
```


#### 4. Check the status of metadata migration

Run the following command to check the status of your metadata migration.

```shell
kubectl describe milvusupgrade my-release-upgrade
```

The status of `Succeeded` in the output means that the metadata migration is successful. 

If failed, the milvus-operator will automatically rollback the changes, and restore the old version of Milvus.

You can also run `kubectl get pod` to check all the pods After the metadata migration is successful.

## 5. Cleanup backups created during the upgrade

During the upgrade, the milvus-operator will create a backup of the metadata. You can delete the backup after the upgrade is successful.

```
$ kubectl delete -f milvusupgrade.yaml
```
